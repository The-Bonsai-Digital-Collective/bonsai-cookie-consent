Display YouTube video thumbnails with a consent overlay until CookieScript marketing consent is granted.

== Description ==

Cookie Consent Video Embed - CookieScript blocks YouTube iframes until consent is given, then lets CookieScript load the real player.

When consent is missing, visitors see:

* A thumbnail image (YouTube thumbnail by default)
* A dark overlay for legibility
* Centered consent message text
* A configurable consent CTA link/button

Plugin settings are available under Settings > Cookie Video Consent.

== Features ==

* Converts YouTube embeds to youtube-nocookie URLs
* Adds CookieScript attributes (`data-src`, `data-cookiecategory`)
* Shows consent placeholder before cookie approval
* Optional global default background image that overrides YouTube thumbnails
* Customisable consent text with safe default fallback
* Customisable consent link label and URL
* If no link URL is set, clicking the CTA attempts to open the CookieScript preferences popup

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress admin.
3. Go to Settings > Cookie Video Consent.
4. Configure consent text, link, and optional default background image.

== GitHub Updates ==

This plugin is configured to use the Plugin Update Checker library for GitHub-based updates.

To enable admin updates from GitHub:

1. Push the full plugin to a GitHub repository, including the `vendor/` folder.
2. Ensure the repository URL in the main plugin file matches your repo.
3. Create GitHub Releases and attach the plugin zip as a release asset.
4. Keep the plugin version header higher than the installed version for each release.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
